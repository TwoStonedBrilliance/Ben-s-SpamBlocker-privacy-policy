    <h1>Privacy Policy for Ben's SpamBlocker</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Ben</p>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 17, 2025</p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Ben's SpamBlocker ("we," "our," "us," or "the App") is a free call screening application committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our App works and what rights you have regarding your information.</p>
    
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on external servers</li>
        <li>All data is stored locally on your device only using Android's secure DataStore system</li>
        <li>The App requires specific Android system permissions to function as a call blocker</li>
        <li>You have complete control over all blocking settings and preferences</li>
        <li>All blocking features are disabled by default and require your explicit consent to activate</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>Ben's SpamBlocker is built with privacy in mind. We don't:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Collect or send your personal information anywhere</li>
        <li>Track where you go, what you browse, or how you use the app</li>
        <li>Share or sell data to anyone - no third parties, advertisers, or data companies</li>
        <li>Make you create accounts or give us personal details</li>
        <li>Record your calls or save conversation content</li>
        <li>Access your call history or call logs</li>
        <li>Look at your contact information (we only check if incoming numbers match your saved contacts to avoid blocking them)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h2>
    <p>The following information is stored exclusively on your device using Android's encrypted DataStore system:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Call Blocking Preferences:</strong> Your personalized settings for blocking categories (unknown calls, spam/scam calls, toll-free numbers, international calls, and calls from specific geographic area codes)</li>
        <li><strong>Blocked Call Log:</strong> A local record of calls that have been blocked during the call screening process, including phone numbers, timestamps, and blocking reasons for your reference</li>
        <li><strong>App Configuration Settings:</strong> Your preferences for app appearance (dark/light theme) and notification display options</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> This data never leaves your device. It is not transmitted to us, any third parties, or stored on external servers.</p>
    
    <h2>Required Android System Permissions</h2>
    <p>To function as a call screening service, the App requires these Android system permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>READ_PHONE_STATE:</strong> To identify and analyze incoming call information during the call screening process</li>
        <li><strong>ANSWER_PHONE_CALLS:</strong> To manage and block unwanted calls</li>
        <li><strong>READ_CONTACTS:</strong> To ensure calls from your saved contacts are never blocked</li>
        <li><strong>CALL_SCREENING_SERVICE:</strong> To integrate with Android's call screening system</li>
        <li><strong>POST_NOTIFICATIONS:</strong> To display notifications about blocked calls (if enabled)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are used exclusively for call screening and blocking functionality. No data accessed through these permissions is transmitted outside your device.</p>
    
    <h2>How Call Screening Works</h2>
    <p>The app works with information your phone carrier already provides during incoming calls:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What Your Carrier Does:</strong> Your phone company might label incoming calls as "Scam Likely," "Spam Risk," "Telemarketer," "Fraud," or similar warnings</li>
        <li><strong>What You Control:</strong> You decide which types of calls to block based on these labels your carrier provides</li>
        <li><strong>Your Contacts Are Safe:</strong> Calls from people in your phone's contact list never get blocked, no matter what</li>
        <li><strong>Location Blocking:</strong> You can choose to block calls from certain U.S. states or Canadian provinces based on their area codes</li>
        <li><strong>Call Logging:</strong> When a call is blocked during the screening process, basic information (number, time, reason) is saved locally on your device for your reference</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> The app doesn't decide which calls are spam - it only follows your preferences using information your phone carrier already provides during the call screening process.</p>
    
    <h2>Your Data Control Rights</h2>
    <p>You maintain complete control over:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Which types of calls are blocked (all features disabled by default)</li>
        <li>Which geographic areas are blocked</li>
        <li>How and when notifications are displayed</li>
        <li>App appearance and behavior settings</li>
        <li>Your blocked call history (you can delete individual entries or clear all)</li>
        <li>Your data can be completely removed by uninstalling the App or through your device's application data management settings</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services and Advertising</h2>
    <p>We do not currently integrate with third-party services or analytics platforms. We may display advertisements in future app updates to support continued development of this free service. If advertising is implemented, we will update this Privacy Policy to reflect any changes to our data practices.</p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>
    <p>This App does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13 years of age. The App is not directed toward children and does not knowingly collect information from minors.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We might update this Privacy Policy occasionally to keep up with changes in how the app works, legal requirements, or other operational needs. If we make big changes, we'll let you know through app updates, and we'll mark the new "Last Updated" date at the top. If you keep using the app after changes, that means you're okay with the updated policy.</p>
